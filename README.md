### FPV RC Racing Car with Game Effects

Have you ever wondered about having a **FPV RC Racing Car** with game effects such as:
- Boost
- Gun
- Health
- Drift (Bad effects and more)

Well, I have made this with the help of **NFC TAGS**. How it works is simple: when each car has an NFC reader underneath, and when it passes over a NFC tag, it will detect the code and look for what power or bad effect it is. Then I can pull that effect whenever we want. Beat your opponent and win with super powers using our own strategy to win the game!

## Motivation

I have always wondered to play **RC car** like in games with boost, power, win, health etc.. because that all make more fun for the world and playing with friends makes it even more fun. So I built this car - it will give you a game vibe with RC FPV cars in real life, bringing more fun and joy to the world!
## How to Build 🛠️

### Car Assembly

After 3D printing, check the tolerance of each part and sand it smoothly for better look and placement. Then solder everything with wires, place each component in its designated position as shown in the `.step` files, glue the IR receiver and transmitter, tape or glue the batteries in their places, place ESP32 on the ESP tray and screw it well, then mount to the car body as shown.

### Remote Assembly

After 3D printing, check the tolerance of each part and sand it smoothly for better look and placement. Then solder everything with wires, place the battery first followed by ESP32, solder the switch to PCB and connect the GPIOs Don't forget to place the LCD screen holders to screw for better holding, slide down the bottom part and screw it also then paint everything.

## How to Play/Setup 🎮

When you turn on the remote and car, it will connect (if it's your first time,you may need to pair them) You'll get a web interface in phone or laptop for FPV. Once connected you have two modes:

### Free Ride Mode
You can drive it as normal RC car without any special features.

### Race Mode  
In this mode, you need an opponent to play with. One of you will host the game and that person's car becomes the controller of the game also. The remote looks for players  when a player is found:
- Flip the car and reegister all NFC tags again
- Accept the win gate tag and pit lane
- Place everthing in place as you want
- Everywhere, you can make your own track with anything you have
- Play and win the game
## Game Effects ⚡

### Good Power-ups
- **Boost** - Speed boost to move faster  
- **Health** - Get more health  
- **Shield** - Protection from enemy bullets  
- **Bullets** - Shoot projectiles  

### Bad Effects
- **Drift** - The car gets drift randomly  
- **Random Control** - Controls switch randomly (forward becomes backward)  
- **Slowness** - Car goes slowly  
- **Damage** - Low health  

### Bonus Feature
All bad effects can be cleared by going to your own pit lane.
## How It Works ⚙️

This all works with ESP-NOW protocol. The host's car maintains the rules and everything:

- `car ↔ remote` - Direct communication between each unit  
- `car(host) ↔ car(client)` - Host communicates with client cars  
- `camera → WiFi web → phone, laptop...` - Video stream to viewer devices

# Future Upgrade ⏫

* Leader Board 
* Anti-Cheat
* challenge etc

Thats it for now.
> **NOTE:** you need to place a black transparent plastic thin sheet or something on the front window where the camera is placed and in the remote for the switch you can either use this Prototyping PCB or you can custom print a pcb board everything on car and remote is either snap fit or screwable and only the led , ir and batter need glue-gun/tap
